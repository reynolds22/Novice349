            <h2>Why This?</h2>
            <p>I made this site to give myself a good gym schedule that I can both stick to and see results.</p>

            <h2>A Little caution</h2>
            <p>With all of this workout advice, I would still recommend looking into how to do each workout to perfect form, increase results, and prevent injuries.</p>

            <h2>Food?</h2>
            <p>Arguably as important as working out itself would be what you do in the kitchen. While this site does not offer any guide on food it is worthy noting how importaint a proper diet is to either lose weight or gain muscle.</p>
