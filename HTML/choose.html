            <h2>The Muscles</h2>
            <p>Here we target all of the main muscles for a full workout every week. Here we look at the upper which targets a lot smaller muscles including the chest, back, shoulders, biceps, and triceps. Then lower having glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves. With the upper part having smaller muscles we will push the ab workouts with lower.</p>

            <h2>The 4 Day Split</h2>
            <p>The four-day split is well known as one of the best weakly workout routines for many beginner to average gym goers. Much of the reason for this being it allows two days of working out different muscles than a brief break and back on another two days before a weekend break.</p>

            <h2>The Upper/Lower Split</h2>
            <p>The four-day split works With first starting with the upper body (upper) on Monday then moving to the lower body (lower) on Tuesday and then taking a break day on Wednesday. Then moving back to upper on Thursday and again lower on Friday. This all allows for about two days of rest between each upper and each lower day.</p>
